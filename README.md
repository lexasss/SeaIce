# SeaIce

The application allows to browse sea ice extension and thickness images from `sidads.colorado.edu` and `ocean.dmi.dk` servers correspondingly.

Note that an alternative color scheme can be applied to visualize ice thickness.

# Installation

The software requires no installation: go to [Releases](https://github.com/lexasss/SeaIce/releases), download and unpack `sea-ice.zip` archive, then launch `SeaIce.exe`.

If the software complains about .NET framework missing in the system, go to [.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.36-windows-x64-installer) webpage, download and install it before trying again.


# Usage

Upon launching the app, click on a link on either `Extension` or `Thickness` tab, select a date (or multiple dates), click OK, and enjoy the image(s).

To remove images from the list, either use the `Delete` key, or navigate to `extension` or `thickness` folders located in the app's root folder and delete the image files.
